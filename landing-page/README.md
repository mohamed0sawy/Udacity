# Landing Page Project

In this project, I focused in using DOM to do some functionalities like :
* there are sections in the page and I built a navigation bar that helps you to scroll smoothly
to a particular section.
* Also there is a "Add Section" button to create new sections in the page and add their links in the navigation bar.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
