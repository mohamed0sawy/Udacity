# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

In this project, we relied on building server side and client side. This project is asynchronous web app that uses Web-API(OpenWeather) and user data to dynamically fetch data from OpneWeather api and use these data to update the UI to
show the country, temperature, min-and-max temperature, date and user feelings. 
#### NOTES 
* I have built an online version that does not need a local-server to work. If you interested you can check it out from here :
